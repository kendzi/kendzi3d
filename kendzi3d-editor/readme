
This project provide buildings builder.

*** How to build

Now you can build this project using command 
maven install


*** How to run (outside an IDE)

To run the jar you need to have correct dependencies in the classpath.
The following bash snippet will attempt to find the correct jars in
the locations set by the variables JARS, JOGL and WORK.

#M2="$HOME/.m2/repository"       # local maven repo, uncomment if you used 'maven install' to populate it
                                 #                   in this case directories below will not be searched
JARS="/usr/share/java"           # folder with system-wide installed jars
JOGL="$HOME/.josm/plugins/jogl"  # folder with jogl-all*.jar and gluegen-rt*.jar
WORK="$HOME/workspace"           # (top-level-dir) of kendzi-*.jar snapshot builds

for DEP in {gluegen-rt,jogl-all}-2.3 {aopalliance,atinject-jsr330-api,guava,guice,log4j-1.2,vecmath}-[0-9] \
           kendzi-math-geometry-[0-9] \
           kendzi3d-jogl-{util,model-util,model-render,textures,textures-library-res} \
           kendzi3d-resource{-interface,-manager,s} \
           kendzi3d-editor
do
   find ${M2:-"$JARS" "$JOGL" "$WORK"} -iname "${DEP}*jar" | grep -v -- "-native\|-sources" | sort | tail -1
   find ${M2:-"$JARS" "$JOGL" "$WORK"} -iname "${DEP}*native*jar"
done \
| tee /dev/stderr | paste -s -d ':' | xargs -I CP java -cp "CP" kendzi.kendzi3d.editor.example.ExampleMain


If you got NoClassDefFound errors using the above, running with M2 unset,
then some necessary jars might not have been installed system-wide.  On
debian based systems missing jars can be checked and installed using

for DEP in {aopalliance,atinject-jsr330-api,guice,log4j-1.2,vecmath}
do
   if [[ -z "$M2" && ! -e "$JARS/$DEP.jar" ]]
   then echo lib${DEP/-1.2/1.2}-java
   fi
done \
| tee /dev/stderr | xargs -r sudo apt-get install
