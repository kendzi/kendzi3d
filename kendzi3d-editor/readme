to find the correct jars in the locations listed below.

#M2="$HOME/.m2/repository"       # local maven repo, uncomment if you used 'maven install' to populate it
                                 #                   in this case directories below will not be searched
JARS="/usr/share/java"           # folder with vecmath*.jar and log4j*.jar
JOGL="$HOME/.josm/plugins/jogl"  # folder with jogl-all*.jar and gluegen-rt*.jar
WORK="$HOME/workspace"           # (top-level-dir) of kendzi-*.jar snapshot builds

if [[ -z "$M2" && ! -e "$JARS/aopalliance.jar" ]]
then sudo apt-get install libaopalliance-java
fi

for DEP in javax.inject {aopalliance,guice,log4j,vecmath,kendzi-math-geometry}-[0-9] {gluegen-rt,jogl-all}-2.3 \
           kendzi3d-jogl-{util,model-util,model-render,textures,textures-library-res} \
           kendzi3d-resource-{interface,manager} \
           kendzi3d-editor
do
   find ${M2:-"$JARS" "$JOGL" "$WORK"} -iname "${DEP}*jar" | grep -v -- "-native\|-sources" | sort | tail -1
   find ${M2:-"$JARS" "$JOGL" "$WORK"} -iname "${DEP}*native*jar"
