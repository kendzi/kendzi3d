/**
 * Specifies texture coordinates for a rectangular area of a texture. Note that
 * some textures are inherently flipped vertically from OpenGL's standard
 * coordinate system. This class takes care of this vertical flip so that the
 * "bottom" and "top" coordinates may sometimes be reversed. From the point of
 * view of code rendering textured polygons, it can always map the bottom and
 * left texture coordinates from the TextureCoords to the lower left point of
 * the textured polygon and achieve correct results.
